## About 
Anaïs C. Murat is a PhD candidate in Computer Science at [Trinity College Dublin](https://tcd.ie) since September 2021. She is part of the third cohort being funded by the **Science Foundation Ireland’s Centre for Research Training in Artificial Intelligence [(CRT-AI)](https://crt-ai.ie)**. Particularly interested in syntax and, more broadly, in the underlying rules and patterns governing human interactions, she investigates how these concepts can be applied to the field of Artificial Intelligence.

Coming from human sciences, she holds a diploma in English Literature and Civilisation, a Bachelor’s degree in Sciences of Language from [Université Lumière Lyon 2](https://www.univ-lyon2.fr/) (France), and a first-class honours Master’s Degree in Speech and Language Processing from [Trinity College Dublin](https://tcd.ie).

She is also a founding member of the CRT AI’s Newsletter Team [_The Turing Point_](https://www.crt-ai.ie/news/crt-newsletter-turing-point/).

## Research Interests 

Supervised by Dr. Carl Vogel, she studies the impact of paralinguistic features on human dialogues. More specifically, she studies how gaze can be tracked and used to get insights into the linguistic progression of the interaction. 
Indeed, while eye gaze is known for playing a role in regulating interactions (interaction initiation, turn-taking, showing attention, etc.), her PhD project aims to look into its relationship with the linguistic unfolding of the conversation itself. One concrete question implied is the following: _can eye gaze help estimate whether the speaker’s production is more likely to repeat previous information or, instead, bring new vocabulary and move on to another topic?_ 

By investigating such matters, she hopes to help the development of more human-oriented technologies that can make use of multiple modalities to become more and more accessible.

## Training
### ESSLI 2022, Galway, Ireland.
She attended the 2022 European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information
(ESSLLI) that was taking place at the University of Galway. Thus having the opportunity to follow the courses:
- MULTIMODAL SEMANTICS FOR AFFORDANCES AND ACTIONS, James Pustejovsky
and Nikhil Krishnaswamy
- ADVANCED COURSE ON COMPUTATIONAL MODELS OF GROUNDING IN DIALOGUE,
David Traum
- MULTIMODAL INTERACTION IN DIALOGUE AND ITS MEANING, Jonathan Ginzburg
and Andy Lücking
- A LINGUIST’S GUIDE TO NEURAL NETWORK, Tim Van de Cruys
  
and workshop:
- Annotation, Recognition and Evaluation of Actions II (AREA-II)

### CRT-AI Training Weeks
As part of the agreement between her funding body, the Centre for Research and Training in
Artificial Intelligence (CRT-AI), she attended five training weeks during the first year
of her PhD programme. These weeks were thematised: Machine Learning at the University of Limerick,
Natural Language Learning at the University of Galway, Reinforcement Learning at Trinity
College Dublin, Computer Vision at Dublin City University, and Constraint Programming at the
University of Cork City. On top of providing an opportunity for socialising with
other PhDs across Ireland, spending these five weeks reviewing the foundations
of AI was an incredible learning opportunity to complement her linguistic background.
